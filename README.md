# Justin Barca's Web Resume

This project is a derivative of [colinhemphill's nextjs-resume](https://github.com/colinhemphill/nextjs-resume) which you should see for documentation.

Because this project is exclusively for personal purposes, [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and changelogs have been abandoned. However, significant upstream changes are integrated back into it intermittently.

The major divergence from forked template is the integration of Prismic as the CMS. The multi-CMS setup of the parent repo has been abandoned for the purposes of simplification.
